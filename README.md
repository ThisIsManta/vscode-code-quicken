# Haste

**Haste** is a powerful **VS Code** extension for creating file-based snippets, such as `import` and `require` statements in JavaScript.

This extension is heavily inspired by [**Quick Require**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=milkmidi.vs-code-quick-require), but it is written from scratch because the latter one supported only `import` and `require` in JavaScript and could not be customized at all. For example, in some JavaScript convention, you might want to omit the JavaScript file extension (`.js`) and the semi-colon (`;`) at the end of the line, hence it becomes `import MyFile from './MyFile'`.

You can also create a snippet for other languages as well, such as `@import './MyDesign.styl'` in [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/docs/import.html).

## Basic usage

Simply press _Ctrl+Shift+I_ on your keyboard to list all macthing files, and choose one file that you would like to insert a snippet based on it.

Given the below settings, when pressing _Ctrl+Shift+I_, it will list all JavaScript files and insert a snippet `import MyFile from './MyFile.js';` before your first import statement. As you can see, `path` is a glob pattern matching all JavaScript files recusively, `code` is an ES6 template string (actually, it will be passed onto [lodash's template function](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.4#template)), and `insertAt` represents the position of the code to be inserted.

```
"haste.files": [
  {
    "path": "**/*.js",
    "code": "import ${selectFileInfo.fileNameWithoutExtension} from '${selectFilePath}';\n",
    "insertAt": "beforeFirstImport"
  }
]
```

## Working with multiple file patterns

You can add multiple file patterns, so that it will insert one snippet for one kind of file, while it will insert another snippet for a different kind of file. Let's say you want to import another `js` and `css` files into a JavaScript file, choosing `MyFile.js` will insert `import MyFile from './MyFile.js';`, while choosing `MyDesign.css` will insert `import './MyDesign.css';`.

```
"haste.files": [
  {
    "path": "**/*.js",
    "code": "import ${selectFileInfo.fileNameWithoutExtension} from '${selectFilePath}';\n"
  },
  {
    "path": "**/*.css",
    "code": "import '${selectFilePath}';\n"
  }
]
```

## Working with one file in different context

Supposed you want to import one file to two different kind of files, such as importing `MyDesign.css` to both `MyFile.js` and `ChrisDesign.css`. You need two patterns which share the same `path`, but specifying when to use which pattern in `when` expression.

```
"haste.files": [
  {
    "path": "**/*.css",
    "when": "activeFileInfo.fileExtensionWithoutLeadingDot === 'js'",
    "code": "import ${selectFilePath};\n"
  },
  {
    "path": "**/*.css",
    "when": "activeFileInfo.fileExtensionWithoutLeadingDot === 'css'",
    "code": "@import '${selectFilePath}';\n"
  }
]
```

## Perks of JavaScript _(and TypeScript too)_

When importing JavaScript files, the extension will genuinely check if the chosen file has been imported already. This prevents duplicate import statements.

The extension also checks if the importing JavaScript file has `export default` or `module.exports`, so that you can use a variable `selectFileHasDefaultExport` in `code` setting.

```
"haste.files": [
  {
    "path": "**/*.js",
    "code": "import ${selectFileHasDefaultExport ? '' : '* as '}${selectFileInfo.fileNameWithoutExtension} from '${selectFilePath}';\n"
  }
]
```

Instead of writting `import MySuite from './MySuite/index.js';`, you can write `import MySuite from './MySuite';` without specifying `index.js`. This is also possible by turning `omitIndexInSelectFilePath` setting to `true`.

```
"haste.files": [
  {
    "path": "**/*.js",
    "code": "import ${selectFileInfo.fileNameWithExtension === 'index.js' ? selectFileInfo.directoryName : selectFileInfo.fileNameWithoutExtension} from '${selectFilePath}';\n",
    "omitIndexInSelectFilePath": true
  }
]
```

## Working with **Node.js**

Furthermore, this extension also supports **Node.js** module snippets. The below is the default for `haste.nodes` setting. Since some node modules contain one or more dashes (`-`), which cannot be used in a JavaScript variable, a helping function `getProperVariableName()` can sanitize it. For example, `react-dom` will become `import reactDom from 'react-dom';`.

```
"haste.nodes": {
  {
    "name": "*",
    "code": "import ${getProperVariableName(moduleName)} from '${moduleName}';\n"
  }
}
```

## File settings

```
"haste.files": [
  {
    "path": string | string[],
    "when": string,
    "code": string | string[],
    "omitIndexInSelectFilePath": boolean,
    "omitExtensionInSelectFilePath": boolean | string,
    "insertAt": string
  },
  ...
]
```

- `path`: a [glob pattern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob#glob-primer) of files to be listed in the quick pick.  
Specifying an exclamation mark (`!`) in front of the pattern will exclude those files from the list.
	```
	// This shows every JavaScript files
	"haste.files": [
	  {
		"path": "**/*.js",
		"code": "import ${selectFileInfo.fileNameWithoutExtension} from '${selectFilePath}';\n"
	  }
	]
	```
	```
	// This shows every JavaScript files, except ones in "node_modules" folder
	"haste.files": [
	  {
		"path": ["**/*.js", "!node_modules"],
		"code": "import ${selectFileInfo.fileNameWithoutExtension} from '${selectFilePath}';\n"
	  }
	]
	```

- `when`: a JavaScript boolean expression to control when this pattern is available against the current viewing document.  
You may use one or more following pre-defined variables:
  - `_` as **[lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)**.
  - `minimatch` as **[minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch)**.
  - `path` as **Node.js**' [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html).
  - `activeDocument` as [vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#TextDocument).
  - `activeFileInfo` as [FileInfo](#fileinfo-properties) object of the current viewing document.
	```
	// This shows every JavaScript files when the current viewing file name does not end with ".spec"
	"haste.files": [
	  {
		"path": "**/*.js",
		"when": "activeFileInfo.fileNameWithoutExtension.endsWith('.spec') === false",
		"code": "import ${selectFileInfo.fileNameWithoutExtension} from '${selectFilePath}';\n"
	  }
	]
	```

- `code`: an ES6 template string to be inserted to the current viewing document.  
You may use one or more following pre-defined variables:
  - `activeDocument` as [vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#TextDocument).
  - `activeFileInfo` as [FileInfo](#fileinfo-properties) object of the current viewing document.
  - `selectFileInfo` as [FileInfo](#fileinfo-properties) object of the chosen file.
  - `selectFilePath` as a normalized _relative file path_ of the chosen file. This has `./` at the beginning if and only if the chosen file and the current viewing document are in the same folder. This can be used safely in JavaScript `import` statement.
  - `selectCodeText` as a whole text of the chosen file.
  - `selectCodeTree` as a parsed **[Babylon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylon)** object of the chosen file.
  - `selectFileHasDefaultExport` as boolean that is `true` when the chosen file has `export default` or `module.exports`, otherwise `false`.
  - `_` as **[lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)**.
  - `minimatch` as **[minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch)**.
  - `path` as **Node.js**' [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html).
  - `getProperVariableName(string)` as a helping function that sanitizes the input string to a proper JavaScript variable name, such as `react-dom` to `reactDom`.
  - `findInCodeTree(codeTree, object)` as a helping function that returns `true` if and only if at least one branch in the given `codeTree` matches the given `object`, otherwise `false`.

- `omitIndexInSelectFilePath`: a boolean to control whether a file named `index` must not present in the variable `selectFilePath` of `code` setting.  
The default value is `false`.

- `omitExtensionInSelectFilePath`: a boolean or glob pattern of file extensions to remove from `selectFilePath` variable of `code` setting.  
Specifying `true` will strip all extension from `selectFilePath` variable of `code` setting.  
The default value is `false`.

- `insertAt`: a position of code to be inserted to the current viewing document.  
The possible values are: `"beforeFirstImport"`, `"afterLastImport"`, `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"cursor"`.  
The default value is `cursor`.

## Node module settings

```
"haste.nodes": [
  {
    "name": string,
    "code": string | string[],
    "insertAt": string
  },
  ...
]
```

- `name`: a [glob pattern](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob#glob-primer) of node module name.  
	```
	// This shows every node module that starts with `react`
	"haste.files": [
	  {
		"path": "react*",
		"code": "import ${getProperVariableName(moduleName)} from '${selectFilePath}';\n"
	  }
	]
	```

- `code`: an ES6 template string to be inserted to the current viewing document.  
You may use one or more following pre-defined variables:
  - `activeDocument` as [vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/vscode-api#TextDocument).
  - `activeFileInfo` as [FileInfo](#fileinfo-properties) object of the current viewing document.
  - `moduleName` as the name of the select node module.
  - `moduleVersion` as a version written in _package.json_ inside the select node module.
  - `_` as [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash).
  - `minimatch` as [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch).
  - `path` as [path](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html).
  - `getProperVariableName(string)` as a helping function that sanitizes the input string to a proper JavaScript variable name, such as `react-dom` to `reactDom`.

- `insertAt`: a position of code to be inserted to the current viewing document.  
This is similar to [File settings](#file-settings).

## JavaScript parser settings

This extension uses **[Babylon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylon)** as a JavaScript parser, so it can detect `import` and `export` keywords. You may find the possible values for the plug-in names from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babylon#plugins). The default value is showing below.

```
"haste.javascript.parser.plugins": [
  "classProperties",
  "objectRestSpread",
  "exportExtensions",
  "asyncGenerators",
  "functionBind"
]
```

## **FileInfo** object

**FileInfo** is an object instance containing path-file-extension information.

- `localPath`: a string represents path in the current operating system. For example, `c:\user\MyFile.js` in Windows, and `/c/user/MyFile.js` in Unix-like. 
- `unixPath`: a string represents path in Unix-like operating system.
- `fileNameWithExtension`
- `fileNameWithoutExtension`
- `fileExtensionWithoutLeadingDot`
- `directoryPath`: a string represents series of directories to the path.
- `directoryName`: a string represents only the containing directory to the path.

For example, if you are working with **React**, you need to add `"jsx"` as one of the plug-ins, so this extension is able to work smoothly.
